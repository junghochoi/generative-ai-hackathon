# Generative AI Demo

## Overview

This project originated from an internal hackathon at Yext, aiming to streamline the testing process for potential customers interested in the Yext platform. Yext customers typically deal with a variety of entities related to their businesses, such as employees, products, locations, and more. Creating dummy entities for testing purposes can be a time-consuming task.

To address this challenge, we created this GitHub project to automate the generation of entities on the Yext platform, making it easier for users to test and evaluate the platform's capabilities.

## Usage

To get started, users are prompted to provide some key information:

- **Username:** Your username for a personalized experience.
- **Industry:** Specify the industry relevant to your business.
- **Company Vision and Goals:** Share insights into your company's vision and goals.
- **Example Entities:** Provide a list of example entities related to your business.

Based on this input, the system suggests a list of proposed entity types tailored to the user's context. Users can then choose their desired entity types for testing on the Yext Platform.

## Tools Used

- **Frontend:** Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Powered by Python and Flask, integrating the ChatGPT API for natural language understanding. Additionally, Java and gRPC are utilized for seamless communication between components.
